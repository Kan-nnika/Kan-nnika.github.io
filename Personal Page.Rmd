### About Me

My name is Kannika Pho. I started off in Sac State as a Mathematic major and added Computer Science as my second major soon after. I am not very active in CS field. Big data and data management are what I'm interested in. Yet, I'm still undecided for the most part. So I'm open to anything. I worked as a PAL facilitator for Math 32 on-campus and as a summer leader for a community service program. Currently, I work as a Math tutor/academic mentor off-campus.
