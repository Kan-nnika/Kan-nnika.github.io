### About Me

My name is Kannika Pho. I graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics: an emphasis in Statistics and a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I am a graduate student in M.S. Statistics with Data Science concentration at California State University, East Bay and also working for Pearson as a Software Data Analyst. Since I am set to graduate at the end of 2022, I am looking for an opprtunity to explore a teaching career. Back in my undergraduate years, I worked as a PAL facilitator for Calculus III on-campus and also a math tutor/mentor off-campus. I love helping students with math, statisitics, and data science questions. Mathematics have always been my favorite subject throughout my academic years, the same goes to statistics.
