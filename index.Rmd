My name is Kannika Pho. I started off in Sac State as a Mathematic major and added Computer Science as my minor soon after. I am not very active in CS field. Big data and data management are what I'm interested in. I have an emphasis in Statistics. I am eager to learn and expand my knowledge on data science field. I worked as a PAL facilitator for Calculus III on-campus and as a summer leader for a community service program. Currently, I work as a Math tutor/academic mentor off-campus.
